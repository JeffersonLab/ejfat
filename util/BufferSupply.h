    /**
     * This class was originally written in Java and is translated to C++ here.
     * It is used to provide a very fast supply of ByteBuffer objects
     * (actually ByteBufferItem objects each of which wraps a ByteBuffer)
     * for reuse in 2 different modes (uses Disruptor software package).<p>
     *
     * 1) It can be used as a simple supply of ByteBuffer(Item)s.
     * In this mode, only get() and release() are called. A user does a {@link #get()},
     * uses that buffer, then calls {@link #release()} when done with it. If there are
     * multiple users of a single buffer (say 5), then call bufferItem.setUsers(5)
     * before it is used and the buffer is only released when all 5 users have
     * called release().<p>
     *
     * 2) It can be used as a supply of ByteBuffers in which a single
     * producer provides data for a single consumer which is waiting for that data.
     * The producer does a {@link #get()}, fills the buffer with data, and finally does a {@link #publish()}
     * to let the consumer know the data is ready. Simultaneously, a consumer does a
     * {@link #consumerGet()} to access the data buffer once it is ready. To preserve all the data
     * as the producer wrote it, use the {@link BufferSupplyItem#getBuffer()} when getting
     * the data buffer. The consumer then calls {@link #release()} when finished
     * which allows the producer to reuse the now unused buffer.<p>
     *
     *
     * <pre><code>
     *
     *   This is a graphical representation of how our ring buffer is set up in mode 2.
     *
     *   (1) The producer who calls get() will get a ring item allowing a buffer to be
     *       filled. That same user does a publish() when done filling buffer.
     *
     *   (2) The consumer who calls consumerGet() will get that ring item and will
     *       use its data. That same user does a release() when done with the buffer.
     *
     *   (3) When the consumer calls release() it frees the ring item to be used by the producer again.
